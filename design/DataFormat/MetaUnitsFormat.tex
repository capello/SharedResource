Meta data unit have a particular format.
The first bytes of the file contain \emph{RS-META}\footnote{This is a 0 string terminated. So there are 8 characters reserved.}.
Then start real contain.
See Figure~\ref{fig:META-FILE-FORMAT} for more detail.
The next 8 bytes are the same than 8 first.
\begin{itemize}
 \item If the bytes in range [8..15] are not the same than in range [0..7] that means file is encrypted.
The key is not store by Share Resource library.
User software must delegate a key and the library will search the meta units that unlock.
The key is a symetric key.
 \item If the bytes in range [8..15] are the same than in range [0..7] that means unit is not encrypted.
\end{itemize}

Data in the \emph{META unit} are serialized\footnote{That means that data can be stored with no order.}.
