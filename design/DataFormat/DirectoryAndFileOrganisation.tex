Files are store in a directory.
Files represents Meta data storage units, or Data storage units.
Files are parts of a global resource.
We degign by “\emph{root}” directory the base directory use for storage.
The storage unit class, performs an SHA1 sum and set the name of the resource with this sum.
The first two characters of name are used to hash the files in \emph{root} directory.
The file name is not truncated in the subdirectory.
So, the first two characters of files in a subdirectory are the same for all files.
